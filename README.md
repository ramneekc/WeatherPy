# What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API.  

Created scatter plots among the following relationships:  
1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Conclusion
1.The temperature tends to increase near the equator and decreases as you go towards the either poles.  
2.Humidity increases as you go towards the north pole.  
3.Most cities have low wind speed on either side of the eqauator.
